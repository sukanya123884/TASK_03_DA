# So in this task , I use sqlite3 in jupyter Notebook for sql queries.
# I have used dataset from Kaggle.([Sample-Superstore.csv]).
# In [install_sql.ipynb], I have installed necessary libraries and created a sql database, where I uploaded my csv file as name 'superstore'.
# Now, in [query.ipynb], I have done all the sql queries.
# Finally, I save my notebook and exported it as a html file [query.html] for user friendly view. 
# One can see sql queries in either the ipynb file or the html file.
